In the field of software engineering, ethics is a bit of a tricky subject. It can be hard to gauge what exactly is and is not within reason when as a programmer your primary function is to make a computer or other machine perform a typically very specific task. Determining what externalities that task might create is often limited to the programmer’s own imagination. It is practically impossible to ward against all misuse of your code, what you can control though, is the quality and the function of your code. Ethics in software engineering revolves heavily around making sure your code is the best it can be. Your code represents you, what is done with your code after you have released it publically is beyond your scope as the programmer. As an example, we can look at a situation encountered by Bill Sourour early in his career that he writes about in “The code I’m still ashamed of”.

At the time of the events he describes, Mr. Sourour was 21 and had just started at a full-time job coding. Sourour was tasked with creating an interactive quiz for a website promoting a specific pharmaceutical drug. The quiz itself however set off a red flag for Sourour since all option paths other than being allergic to or already taking the drug recommended starting on the drug; this was specified by the client as the desired behavior for the quiz. Sourour released despite his reservations and received commendations from the client, however, he questioned his judgements when he learned a girl had taken the drug he designed the quiz for and had committed suicide likely as a result of the drug’s side effects.

Sourour felt responsible at least partially since he coded a quiz that clearly biasedly promoted the drug. However at the end of the day, Sourour did his job and had he chosen differently and not released since he felt concerns regarding the quiz, nothing would have likely changed in following events. The company would have assigned someone else to produce the quiz and all events would have proceeded identically afterward. What Sourour did do, however, was create a working product for his client.

Ultimately it is the responsibility of the programmer to make sure his or her program functions as he or she say it does to the smallest decimal. If you are tasked with making a quiz, you had better make sure your quiz does not crash computers or increase your project’s bounce rates or any number of issues stemming from the quiz itself. Beyond that is outside of your effective scope within a typical company environment. If someone wants a program and you are uncomfortable coding it, your best course of action is the not code it, just know that someone else will.
