## Overveiw

Due to the constant supply of surplus textbooks at the end each semester, it is thus proposed a student textbook trading board. Students can post their uneeded textbooks and desired price on the exchange. Interested students can contact the seller via UH email.
* Students must login to the trading board using their UH login.
* No usernames/aliases
* All transactions must take place on campus for security reasons.
* Items must fit into predetermined “dorm-related/approved” categories.
* Students can be banned for violations of the terms of use
* Communication is via UH email
