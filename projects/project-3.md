Utilities is a collection of data structures and sorting algorithms for use in developing Java projects.

This collection includes structures such as lists, queues, trees, and hashtables.

The sorts contained in this collection are bubble, insertion, selection, heap, merge, and quick sort. All sorting algorithms sort by a user  Comparator from least to greatest.

This collection is posted on this page primarily because I highly enjoy coding data storage and retrieval systems. All of the classes in this collection come from my work in ICS 211 Data Structures.
