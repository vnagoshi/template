RGBStudios.org is a web development organization started by Justin Golden at San Diego State University. As a developer at RGB Studios, I built the organization website. The website is primarilly built using the standard HTML, JS, CSS combination in addition to some Semantic UI styling, however additional resources such as W3.JS and SASS were experimented with during development.

RGBStudios.org hosts a number of useful web applications designed by RGB Studios' developers. These applications include different types of calculators, reference charts, and Chrome apps. RGBStudios.org also hosts links to a number of Chrome themes and AMVs (Anime Music Videos) created by RGB Studios' developers.
