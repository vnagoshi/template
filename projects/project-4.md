RGBStudios.org is a web development organization started by Justin Golden at San Diego State University. As a developer at RGB Studios, I built the organization website.

The website hosts a number of useful web applications designed by RGB Studios' developers. These applications include a number of different calculators, reference charts, and Chrome apps. RGBStudios.org also hosts links to a number of Chrome themes and AMVs (Anime Music Videos) created by RGB Studios' developers.
