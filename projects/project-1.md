MACD Tracker is a Java Application that calculates the MACD indicator for stocks and recommends buy and sell signals accordingly for each tracked stock.

MACD tracker will display a stock's open, close, high, and low prices for a given date, the stocks volume, and historical data for the stock for up to a year. It will also show you when a buy or a sell signal was given successfully.
