Sticker Book is a Java application in which you can place stickers on a page, save your designs, and interact with your stickers.

In addition to simply placing stickers, Sticker Book comes with a number of modes and features. You can place one sticker at a time, or place as many as you want without stopping. You can move your placed stickers and even preview where you are going to place your stickers. You can erase stickers one at a time, or all at once. You can even change the theme of the application swapping between cats and dogs.
